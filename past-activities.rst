Cited as one of the major contributor to ROS Electric for the port to Python3,
support of ROS on Nao robot.

Technical background
--------------------

Several open-source packages that are used beyond the walls of the original lab
(knowledge base for robotics, natural language processing package, versatile 3D
simulation package). cf GitHub.

Hand-on experience on several robotic platforms, including PR2, Nao, 1- &
2-hand mobile manipulators.

Teaching
--------

Teaching assistant (*moniteur*) at INSA Toulouse for 3 years: Prolog,
ontologies, advanced Java, ADA, advanced databases.

Several tutorials at both local and international levels, on technical topics
ranging from software development techniques (code versioning, building tools)
and programming (Python) to robotics simulation (including a tutorial during EURON2012 conference, Danemark).
